This is my effort to recreate the board game Mastermind as a computer game, passing the boring and predictable role of codemaker to the computer, and giving the player the much more fun task of being the codebreaker.

I originally had the idea to recreate Mastermind as part of a computer science class project; however, I lost the source code and executable for the completed project, so I have since decided to remake the game, this time in JavaScript instead of C, and host it for others to play as well. Enjoy!
